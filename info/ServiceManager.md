# ServiceManager

ServiceManager is a script that lets you manage Windows services without needing to learn every command. Just by following the questions that will guide you through the possibilities of this script, you can change things as the status of the service or even the display name.

It has many options to manage our services:

- ### Status

Let's us choose a service and change it's status to one of the following:
Start | Stop | Resume | Suspend | Restart | Remove

> [!Note]
> The stop option will also stop the services that the one we are managing is dependant of.
